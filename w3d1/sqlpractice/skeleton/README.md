To get started, navigate to the skeleton directory and run `bundle install`.
Then navigate to `skeleton/data` and run `./import_db.sh`. This will create the
database for you to work with (or reset it if it has somehow broken).

We recommend going through the exercises in order. You can run the specs one
section at a time using the following syntax:

```
bundle exec rspec spec/01_select_exercises.rb
```

If you need to run sample queries, you can do so in pry or by adding method
calls to the bottom of your `lib/` files and then running them.

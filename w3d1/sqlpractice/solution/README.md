To get started, navigate to the skeleton directory and run `bundle install`.
We recommend going through the exercises in order. You can run the specs one
section at a time using the following syntax:

```
bundle exec rspec spec/01_select_exercises.rb
```

If you need to run sample queries, you can do so in pry or by adding method
calls to the bottom of your `lib/` files and then running them.

Also, if your dataset breaks, you can reset it by running `./import_db.sh`
from the `data/` directory.
